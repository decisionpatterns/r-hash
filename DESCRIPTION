Description: This package implements a data structure similar to dictionaries
    in Python and hashes in Perl and other languages but with a implementation
    and API with an R flavor. For objects of appreciable size, hashes outperform
    native named lists and vectors for lookups. A comprehensive set of functions
    methods and object make hashes flexible and easy to use.
